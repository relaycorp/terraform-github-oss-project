# Terraform module for open source projects by Relaycorp

This module is used by the Relaycorp team to manage their open source projects (mostly on GitHub).

## Development

Use the module at [`examples/self`](./examples/self) to test changes to the root module.

Since this module is meant to be 100% specific to Relaycorp, we will only accept bug fixes from third parties. New features won't be accepted. If you see anything you like here, feel free to use it under the terms of the [licence](https://github.com/relaycorp/terraform-github-oss-project/blob/main/LICENSE).
